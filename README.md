# React | React Landing Page

## Introduction

We just learned the basics about creating a **Hello World** app in React, so we will use this exercise to re-do what we just learned (and hopefully to add some style :blossom: ).

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 - Create the App

Let's start with the basics: as you can see `public` folder is already there and it has some images in it. Let's edit `App.jsx` and other files in order to recreate what we see on the screenshot.

## Iteration 2 - First Landing Page

Let's create our landing page. In the `public` folder, you will find all the assets you need to recreate the following landing page:

![home](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f8660bc79f7dec7f404e0ab984c37152f8305c5a4cd42f397f870532d7d2e2d6/68747470733a2f2f73332d65752d776573742d312e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f69682d6d6174657269616c732f75706c6f6164732f75706c6f61645f32633563323465653035616135666136386137366565653536346164343465652e706e67)

Please, recreate at least one of the elements on the page as an independent component, and add it to the `/src/components` folder.

Happy coding! :heart:
